# JSON_Style
JSON style organizer app for use with Windhawk
 
A simple tool written in HTML, Javascript and CSS to assist with organizing and renumbering control styles and adding descriptions to a flat JSON structure by converting a formatted JSON file, output from Windowhawk's advanced page, into an editable, hierarchical list, which is then used to regenerate the flat JSON. Supports drag-and-drop reordering, editing, adding, duplicating, and deleting targets and styles as well as an embedded color picker.

To use, just download the HTML file. Open file with the browser of your choosing.
